text-destabilizer
=================

A way to destabilize text by replacing words with synonyms.

Select text in the browser and send to the server with the bookmarklet. 

The Sinatra-based back-end uses a WordNet database to look for synonyms, then passes those back to the browser where they're randomly swapped in.
